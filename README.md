### About

From the [Maunalua Fishpond Heritage Center Website](https://maunaluafishpond.org/): 

"Nearly all of Hawai‘i’s freshwater springs have disappeared – many filled in for development, ending the fresh and salt water connection that is critical to the life cycle of many native species. In Kuli‘ou‘ou, we had a rare opportunity to permanently protect a fertile estuary that is home to rare freshwater limpets pipiwai and hapawai that cling to the Hawaiian drystack wall lining the spring, ‘ama‘ama (mullet) and āholehole (young Hawaiian flagtail) that feed on the prized green limu ‘ele‘ele that blankets the spring floor, native shrimp ‘opae ‘oeha‘a and ‘opae huna, and endangered ‘ae‘o (Hawaiian stilts) that feed in Kānewai Fishpond. This effort also protects the many cultural sites surrounding the spring including the mākāhā (fishpond sluice gate), and kū‘ula (fishing stone shrine) with an upright Kū stone balanced by a low Hina stone where the fishermen of old would have given offerings asking for a plentiful catch."

### Goal of this Work

Clean, Analyze, and share data from Kalauhaʻihaʻi and Kānewai with the MFHC Team and surrounding community

The primary product is a Shiny Dashboard that displays pH, oxygen, conductivity, and temperature data collected by [Dr. Lupita](https://lupita-ruiz-jones.squarespace.com/) and students in the Chaminade University of Honolulu Environmental Science Dept from Kalauhaʻihaʻi and Kānewai
